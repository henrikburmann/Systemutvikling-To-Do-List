This is a project under the subject System Development for computer engineer first years.

The application is based on Java and JavaFX. The GUI is made in SceneBuilder by Gluon, the application is buildt with Maven and the JDK is 14.

We had almost no experience building a program with both maven and JavaFX so this project is a reprensentation of our abilities with JavaFX after
a little over 3 months of learning.
